As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I spearheaded two transformative projects: Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) and Cloud-Based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). 

These initiatives showcased my proficiency in optimizing security while prioritizing user convenience. With SSPR, I created tailored user groups, offering customizable authentication options such as email, MFA, and security questions.

In parallel, I deployed Cloud-Based MFA, expertly configuring Conditional Access policies to mandate MFA for all cloud applications. These endeavors fortified security, streamlined user access, and fortified defenses against unauthorized entry. 

My skill set encompasses Self-Service Password Reset, Cloud-Based Multi-Factor Authentication, Conditional Access, User Access Management, and Cybersecurity Enhancement, positioning me as an asset to organizations seeking robust security solutions.
